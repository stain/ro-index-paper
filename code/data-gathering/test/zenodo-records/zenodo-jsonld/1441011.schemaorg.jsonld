The Fraunhofer Digital project,<br>\na part of the Fraunhofer 2022 Agenda, introduces the vision, that research and administrative data will be<br>\nlinked, aggregated and analyzed in order to optimize the research and development processes and support<br>\nmanagement decisions. As a part of this vision, the Research Data in the Fraunhofer Data Space project<br>\ndevelops methods to reuse the research data in a broader sense, and integrate research data silos in various<br>\ninstitutes into Fraunhofer Data Space. In this work we present the concept, early outcomes, and a FAIRness<br>\nassessment of the research data repository approach. In our assessment we used the FAIR metrics, and as a<br>\nresult developed a set of recommendations. These recommendations will be utilized to establish a digital<br>\nresearch data infrastructure as well as a research data reuse culture in Fraunhofer. They can be also useful for<br>\nother large scale institutions with heterogeneous research communities.</p>","headline":"Research Data in the Fraunhofer Digital Project : Creating a FAIR Research Data Infrastructure and Culture","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1441011","image":"https://zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-round.svg","inLanguage":{"@type":"Language","alternateName":"eng","name":"English"},"keywords":["Research Data Infrastructure","Data reuse","Fraunhofer Data Space;","FAIR evaluation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"Research Data in the Fraunhofer Digital Project : Creating a FAIR Research Data Infrastructure and Culture","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/1441011"}
