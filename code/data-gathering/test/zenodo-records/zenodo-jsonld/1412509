They are &ldquo;system of systems&rdquo;, often mature enough to support reproducibility of science by keeping forms of research objects. Still, often, such research objects are not published as scientific products. Publishing is limited to articles, possibly associated to datasets, and rarely to software. In this article, we present the solution proposed by the OpenAIRE infrastructure to solve this issue, with minimal efforts for research infrastructures and without renouncing any of their services or current practices. OpenAIRE offers a Research Community Dashboard service, designed to flank research infrastructures with scholarly communication services for discovery and publishing of an interlinked graph of articles, datasets, software, and other products, including research objects when these can be built. We present the Research Community Dashboard and its application in a real-case scenario, the one of the European Plate Observing System (EPOS) research infrastructure.</p>","headline":"Enabling Open Science publishing for Research Infrastructures via OpenAIRE: The EPOS use-case","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1412509","image":"https://zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-round.svg","keywords":["reproducibility","Open Science","research objects","OpenAIRE","EPOS"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"Enabling Open Science publishing for Research Infrastructures via OpenAIRE: The EPOS use-case","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/1412509"}
