## Data (and Software) Availability {.page_break_before}

<!--
From https://f1000research.com/for-authors/article-guidelines/study-protocols


All articles must include a Data Availability statement, even where there is no data associated with the article - see our data guidelines and policies for more information.
The Data Availability statement should provide full details of how, where, and under what conditions the data underlying the results can be accessed; for practical guidance please see Add a Data Availability statement to your manuscript. See also Prepare your Data and Select a Repository for further guidance on data presentation, formatting and deposition. 


If you are describing new software, please make the source code available on a Version Control System (VCS) such as GitHub, BitBucket or SourceForge, and provide details of the repository and the license under which the software can be used in the article.
For other scenarios, such as where data cannot be shared, please see Add a Data Availability statement to your manuscript for details of what must be indicated in your Data Availability statement.

 Extended data
There are no figure or table limits for articles in F1000Research. Additional materials that support the key claims in the paper but are not absolutely required to follow the study design and analysis of the results, e.g. questionnaires, supporting images or tables, can be included as extended data; descriptions of the materials and methods should be in the main article. Extended data should be in a format the supports reuse under a CC0 license. Care should be taken to ensure that the publication of extended data in this instance does not preclude primary publication elsewhere.
If you have any extended data, please deposit these materials in an approved repository and include the title, the name of the repository, the DOI or accession number, and license in the manuscript under the subheading ‘Extended data’. Please also include citations to extended data in the main body of the article. For practical guidance please see Add a Data Availability statement to your manuscript. See also Prepare your Data and Select a Repository for further guidance on data presentation, formatting and deposition.
Please note, information which can be used to directly identify participants should not be included in underlying and extended datasets, unless they have provided explicit permission to share their details. Please see our data guidelines for further information.
