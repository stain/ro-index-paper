Many strategies are currently pursued to improve the situation. This article reports the first conclusions from the ActivePapers project, whose goal is the development and application of a computational platform that allows the publication of computational research in a form that enables installation-free deployment, encourages reuse, and permits the full integration of datasets and software into the scientific record. The main finding is that these goals can be achieved with existing technology, but that there is no straightforward way to adapt legacy software to such a framework.</ns4:p>",

    "abstract": "The CWL alignment workflow included in this case study is designed by Data Biosphere. It adapts the alignment pipeline originally developed at Abecasis Lab, The University of Michigan. This workflow is part of NIH Data Commons initiative and comprises of four stages. First step, \"Pre-align'' accepts a Compressed Alignment Map (CRAM) file (a compressed format for BAM files developed by European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)) and human genome reference sequence as input and using underlying software utilities of SAMtools such as view, sort and fixmate returns a list of fastq files which can be used as input for the next step. The next step \"Align'' also accepts the human reference genome as input along with the output files from \"Pre-align'' and uses BWA-mem to generate aligned reads as BAM files. SAMBLASTER is used to mark duplicate reads and SAMtools view to convert read files from SAM to BAM format. The BAM files generated after \"Align'' are sorted with \"SAMtool sort''. Finally, these sorted alignment files are merged to produce single sorted BAM file using SAMtools merge in \"Post-align'' step. This dataset folder is a CWLProv Research Object that captures the Common Workflow Language execution provenance, see https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/0.6.0 or use https://pypi.org/project/cwlprov/ to explore",

Computationally driven data-intensive experiments using workflows enable <strong>A</strong>utomation, <strong>S</strong>caling, <strong>A</strong>daption and <strong>P</strong>rovenance support (<strong>ASAP</strong>). However, there are still several challenges associated with the effective sharing, publication and reproducibility of such workflows due to the incomplete capture of provenance and lack of interoperability between different technical (software) platforms.\n\n<strong>Results:</strong> Based on best practice recommendations identified from literature on workflow design, sharing and publishing, we define a <em>hierarchical provenance framework</em> to achieve uniformity in the provenance and support comprehensive and fully re-executable workflows equipped with domain-specific information. To realise this framework, we present <strong>CWLProv</strong>, a standard-based format to represent any workflow-based computational analysis to produce workflow output artefacts that satisfy the various levels of provenance. We utilise open source community-driven standards; interoperable workflow definitions in Common Workflow Language (CWL), structured provenance representation using the W3C PROV model, and resource aggregation and sharing as workflow-centric Research Objects (RO) generated along with the final outputs of a given workflow enactment. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through a practical implementation of <em>CWLProv</em> and evaluation using real-life genomic workflows developed by independent groups.\n\n<strong>Conclusions: </strong>The underlying principles of the standards utilised by <em>CWLProv</em> enable semantically-rich and executable Research Objects that capture computational workflows with retrospective provenance such that any platform supporting CWL will be able to understand the analysis, re-use the methods for partial re-runs, or reproduce the analysis to validate the published findings.",

The aim of an RO is to evolve from traditional academic publication as a static PDF, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations.\n\nThis is of particular importance as all domains of research and science are increasingly relying on computational analysis, yet we are facing a reproducibility crisis because key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported.\n\nHere we propose <strong>Research Object Crate</strong> (or <strong>RO-Crate</strong> for short), an emerging lightweight approach to packaging research data with their structured metadata, rephrasing the Research Object model as schema.org annotations to formalize a JSON-LD format that can be used independently of infrastructure, e.g. in GitHub or Zenodo archives. RO-Crate can be extended for domain-specific descriptions, aiming at a wide variety of applications and repositories to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.",

    "abstract": "The Common Workflow Language (CWL) project emerged from the BOSC 2014 Codefest as a grassroots, multi-vendor working group to tackle the portability of data analysis workflows. It’s specification for describing workflows and command line tools aims to make them portable and scalable across a variety of computing platforms. <br><br>At its heart CWL is a set of structured text files (YAML) with various extensibility points to the format. However, the CWL syntax and multi-file collections are not conducive to workflow browsing, exchange and understanding: for this we need a visualization suite.<br><br>CWL Viewer is a richly featured CWL visualization suite that graphically presents and lists the details of CWL workflows with their inputs, outputs and steps. It also packages the CWL files into a downloadable Research Object Bundle including attribution, versioning and dependency metadata in the manifest, allowing it to be easily shared. The tool operates over any workflow held in a GitHub repository. Other features include: path visualization from parents and children nodes; nested workflows support; workflow graph download in a range of image formats; a gallery of previously submitted workflows; and support for private git repositories and public GitHub including live updates over versioned workflows. <br><br>The CWL Viewer is the de facto CWL visualization suite and has been enthusiastically received by the CWL community.\n\n\tProject Website: https://view.commonwl.org/\n\tSource Code: https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.823535)\n\tSoftware License: Apache License, Version 2.0\n\tSubmitted abstract: CWL Viewer: The Common Workflow Language Viewer\n\tTechnical Report: Reproducible Research using Research Objects (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.823295)",
