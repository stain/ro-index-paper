In this talk, we&rsquo;ll present the latest progress and outputs from the Reproducible Document Stack project and explore the next steps. In particular, we are seeking collaborations to make Dar interoperable with the Research Object ecosystem.&nbsp;We also welcome the community&rsquo;s suggestions as to the impact they wish to see from this project, and ways in which we could measure this impact together.</p>\n\n<p><em>This abstract was submitted for consideration for the Research Object 2018 workshop within the IEEE eScience 2018 conference.</em></p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1311612","language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"dates":"29 October 2018","place":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","title":"RO2018 workshop at IEEE eScience Conference 2018","url":"http://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/"},"notes":"Preprint submitted to RO2018 workshop at IEEE eScience Conference 2018","publication_date":"2018-07-13","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://github.com/substance/dar","relation":"cites","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://github.com/substance/texture","relation":"cites","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://github.com/stencila","relation":"cites","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1311611","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1311612"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1311611"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"The Reproducible Document Stack reinvents the journal publication for a world of computationally reproducible research"},"owners":[43508],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":76.0,"unique_downloads":66.0,"unique_views":74.0,"version_downloads":76.0,"version_unique_downloads":66.0,"version_unique_views":74.0,"version_views":77.0,"version_volume":5744184.0,"views":77.0,"volume":5744184.0},"updated":"2018-07-13T10:54:02.543436+00:00"}
