This demands better approaches to evaluate and ultimately communicate scholarly outcomes beyond the narrow criteria of publications and grants. It is imperative to develop a structure to track a much wider diversity of contributor roles and research objects - and do so in a manner that is easily populated with real data. This presentation will share details about the project, our team and approach, upcoming opportunities to collaborate, metrics for success, and integration and application of this work to date.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1312652","keywords":["attribution","credit","data model","research objects","contributor roles"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Preprint submitted to RO2018 workshop at IEEE eScience Conference 2018","publication_date":"2018-07-16","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1312651","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":1,"index":0,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1312652"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1312651"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"Making it count: a computational approach to attribution"},"owners":[49487],"revision":3,"stats":{"downloads":72.0,"unique_downloads":65.0,"unique_views":117.0,"version_downloads":72.0,"version_unique_downloads":65.0,"version_unique_views":117.0,"version_views":125.0,"version_volume":4394744.0,"views":125.0,"volume":4394744.0},"updated":"2018-07-16T16:20:13.042570+00:00"}
