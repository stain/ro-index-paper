One important way Research Objects can do this is by encapsulating the means for re-executing the computational components of studies, thus supporting the new form of reproducibility enabled by digital computing---exact repeatability. However, Research Objects also can make scientific research more reproducible by supporting transparency, a component of reproducibility orthogonal to re-executability. We describe here our vision for making Research Objects more transparent by providing means for disambiguating claims about reproducibility generally, and computational repeatability specifically. We show how support for science-oriented queries can enable researchers to assess the reproducibility of Research Objects and the individual methods and results they encapsulate.</p>","headline":"Reproducibility by Other Means: Transparent Research Objects","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3270560","image":"https://zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-round.svg","inLanguage":{"@type":"Language","alternateName":"eng","name":"English"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"Reproducibility by Other Means: Transparent Research Objects","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/3270560","version":"4"}
