The Fraunhofer Digital project,<br>\na part of the Fraunhofer 2022 Agenda, introduces the vision, that research and administrative data will be<br>\nlinked, aggregated and analyzed in order to optimize the research and development processes and support<br>\nmanagement decisions. As a part of this vision, the Research Data in the Fraunhofer Data Space project<br>\ndevelops methods to reuse the research data in a broader sense, and integrate research data silos in various<br>\ninstitutes into Fraunhofer Data Space. In this work we present the concept, early outcomes, and a FAIRness<br>\nassessment of the research data repository approach. In our assessment we used the FAIR metrics, and as a<br>\nresult developed a set of recommendations. These recommendations will be utilized to establish a digital<br>\nresearch data infrastructure as well as a research data reuse culture in Fraunhofer. They can be also useful for<br>\nother large scale institutions with heterogeneous research communities.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.1441011","keywords":["Research Data Infrastructure","Data reuse","Fraunhofer Data Space;","FAIR evaluation"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"acronym":"RO2018","dates":"29 October 2018","place":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","title":"Workshop on Research Objects (RO2018) Workshop at IEEE eScience 2018","url":"http://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/"},"publication_date":"2018-09-06","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1410051","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":2,"index":1,"is_last":true,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1441011"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"1410051"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"Research Data in the Fraunhofer Digital Project : Creating a FAIR Research Data Infrastructure and Culture"},"owners":[49775],"revision":18,"stats":{"downloads":128.0,"unique_downloads":101.0,"unique_views":117.0,"version_downloads":171.0,"version_unique_downloads":129.0,"version_unique_views":141.0,"version_views":182.0,"version_volume":68589894.0,"views":143.0,"volume":49068840.0},"updated":"2018-10-02T17:29:49.960495+00:00"}
