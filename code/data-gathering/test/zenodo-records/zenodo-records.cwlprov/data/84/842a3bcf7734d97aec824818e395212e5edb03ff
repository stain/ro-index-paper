One important way Research Objects can do this is by encapsulating the means for re-executing the computational components of studies, thus supporting the new form of reproducibility enabled by digital computing---exact repeatability. However, Research Objects also can make scientific research more reproducible by supporting transparency, a component of reproducibility orthogonal to re-executability. We describe here our vision for making Research Objects more transparent by providing means for disambiguating claims about reproducibility generally, and computational repeatability specifically. We show how support for science-oriented queries can enable researchers to assess the reproducibility of Research Objects and the individual methods and results they encapsulate.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3270620","language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Preprint submitted to RO2019 workshop at IEEE eScience Conference 2019","publication_date":"2019-07-05","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3270559","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":3,"index":1,"is_last":false,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3382423"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3270559"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"Reproducibility by Other Means: Transparent Research Objects","version":"5"},"owners":[8790],"revision":6,"stats":{"downloads":152.0,"unique_downloads":132.0,"unique_views":301.0,"version_downloads":312.0,"version_unique_downloads":252.0,"version_unique_views":532.0,"version_views":711.0,"version_volume":99986172.0,"views":391.0,"volume":65363040.0},"updated":"2019-09-02T12:37:24.663676+00:00"}
