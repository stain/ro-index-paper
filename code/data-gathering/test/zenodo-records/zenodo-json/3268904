More than 10 million nanopublications have been published by a handful of researchers covering a wide range of topics within the life sciences. We were motivated to replicate an existing analysis of these nanopublications, but then went deeper into the structure of the existing nanopublications. In this paper, we analyse the usage of nanopublications by investigating the distribution of triples in each part and discuss the data quality issues raised by this analysis. From this analysis we argue that there is a need for the community to develop a set of community guidelines for the modelling of nanopublications.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3268904","keywords":["Nanopublication","Semantic Publishing","Semantic Web","Linked Data","Data Quality","Provenance","SPARQL","Jena Fuseki","Virtuoso"],"language":"eng","license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"publication_date":"2019-07-05","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"10.1109/eScience.2018.00024","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_26","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.3268903","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":2,"index":0,"is_last":false,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3358983"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3268903"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"preprint","title":"Preprint","type":"publication"},"title":"Data Quality Issues in Current Nanopublications"},"owners":[69497],"revision":4,"stats":{"downloads":25.0,"unique_downloads":23.0,"unique_views":34.0,"version_downloads":45.0,"version_unique_downloads":39.0,"version_unique_views":53.0,"version_views":63.0,"version_volume":11830685.0,"views":39.0,"volume":6456425.0},"updated":"2019-08-02T15:38:04.154080+00:00"}
