We present our initial design and deployment of DSDB, the results of this work for computational modeling, and conclude with a discussion of the future work necessary for provisioning data discovery and sharing tools that facilitate transparent reproducible research through provenance aware features.</p>","headline":"DSDB: Reproducible Computational Modeling","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3445531","image":"https://zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-round.svg","keywords":["collaborative research","reproducible research","data storage","data provenance"],"license":"","name":"DSDB: Reproducible Computational Modeling","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/3445531"}
