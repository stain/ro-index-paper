The aim of an RO is to replace traditional academic publications of static PDFs, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations.</p>\n\n<p>This is increasingly important as researchers now rely heavily on computational analysis, yet we are facing a <em>reproducibility crisis</em> as key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported.</p>\n\n<p>We are developing <em>Research Object Crate</em> (or <strong>RO-Crate</strong> for short), a lightweight approach to package research data with their structured metadata, based on schema.org annotations in a formalized JSON-LD format that can be used independent of infrastructure to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.</p>","headline":"RO-Crate, a lightweight approach to Research Object data packaging","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3337883","image":"https://zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-round.svg","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"RO-Crate, a lightweight approach to Research Object data packaging","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/3337883"}
