The aim of an RO is to evolve from traditional academic publication as a static PDF, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations.</p>\n\n<p>This is of particular importance as all domains of research and science are increasingly relying on computational analysis, yet we are facing a reproducibility crisis because key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported.</p>\n\n<p>Here we propose <strong>Research Object Crate</strong> (or <strong>RO-Crate</strong> for short), an emerging lightweight approach to packaging research data with their structured metadata, rephrasing the Research Object model as schema.org annotations to formalize a JSON-LD format that can be used independently of infrastructure, e.g. in GitHub or Zenodo archives. RO-Crate can be extended for domain-specific descriptions, aiming at a wide variety of applications and repositories to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.</p>","headline":"A lightweight approach to research object data packaging","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3250687","image":"https://zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-round.svg","keywords":["data packaging","research object","linked data"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"A lightweight approach to research object data packaging","sameAs":["https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-lightweight-approach-to-research-object-data-packaging(5bbfec09-5ff7-43a8-a333-eb0eb0eda6f5).html","https://hdl.handle.net/oai:pure.atira.dk:publications/5bbfec09-5ff7-43a8-a333-eb0eb0eda6f5"],"url":"https://zenodo.org/record/3250687"}
