Computationally driven data-intensive experiments using workflows enable <strong>A</strong>utomation, <strong>S</strong>caling, <strong>A</strong>daption and <strong>P</strong>rovenance support (<strong>ASAP</strong>). However, there are still several challenges associated with the effective sharing, publication and reproducibility of such workflows due to the incomplete capture of provenance and lack of interoperability between different technical (software) platforms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results:</strong> Based on best practice recommendations identified from literature on workflow design, sharing and publishing, we define a <em>hierarchical provenance framework</em> to achieve uniformity in the provenance and support comprehensive and fully re-executable workflows equipped with domain-specific information. To realise this framework, we present <a href=\"https://w3id.org/cwl/prov/\"><strong>CWLProv</strong></a>, a standard-based format to represent any workflow-based computational analysis to produce workflow output artefacts that satisfy the various levels of provenance. We utilise open source community-driven standards; interoperable workflow definitions in <a href=\"https://www.commonwl.org/\">Common Workflow Language</a> (CWL), structured provenance representation using the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/\">W3C PROV</a> model, and resource aggregation and sharing as workflow-centric <a href=\"http://www.researchobject.org/\">Research Objects</a> (RO) generated along with the final outputs of a given workflow enactment. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through a practical implementation of <em>CWLProv</em> and evaluation using real-life genomic workflows developed by independent groups.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong>The underlying principles of the standards utilised by <em>CWLProv</em> enable semantically-rich and executable Research Objects that capture computational workflows with retrospective provenance such that any platform supporting CWL will be able to understand the analysis, re-use the methods for partial re-runs, or reproduce the analysis to validate the published findings.</p>","hasPart":[{"@id":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1471376","@type":"CreativeWork"},{"@id":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1471585","@type":"CreativeWork"},{"@id":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1471589","@type":"CreativeWork"}],"headline":"Sharing interoperable workflow provenance: A review of best practices and their practical application in CWLProv","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1966881","image":"https://zenodo.org/static/img/logos/zenodo-gradient-round.svg","keywords":["Provenance","Common Workflow Language","CWL","Research Object","RO","BagIt","Interoperability","Scientific Workflows","Containers"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","name":"Sharing interoperable workflow provenance: A review of best practices and their practical application in CWLProv","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/1966881"}
