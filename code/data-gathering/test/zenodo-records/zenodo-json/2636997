The aim of an RO is to evolve from traditional academic publication as a static PDF, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations.</p>\n\n<p>This is of particular importance as all domains of research and science are increasingly relying on computational analysis, yet we are facing a reproducibility crisis because key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported.</p>\n\n<p>Here we propose <strong>Research Object Lite</strong> (or <strong>RO-Lite</strong> for short), an emerging lightweight approach to packaging research data with their structured metadata, rephrasing the Research Object model as schema.org annotations to formalize a JSON-LD format that can be used independently of infrastructure, e.g. in GitHub or Zenodo archives. RO-Lite can be extended for domain-specific descriptions, aiming at a wide variety of applications and repositories to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.2636997","grants":[{"acronym":"BioExcel","code":"675728","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::675728"},"program":"H2020","title":"Centre of Excellence for Biomolecular Research"}],"keywords":["data packaging","research object","linked data"],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"notes":"Talk abstract submitted for consideration at Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC2019).","publication_date":"2019-04-12","related_identifiers":[{"identifier":"https://researchobject.github.io/ro-lite/","relation":"documents","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"http://github.com/researchobject/ro-lite","relation":"documents","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.1038/533452a","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.1016/j.future.2011.08.004","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.1016/j.websem.2015.01.003","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.1109/eScience.2017.40","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.51314","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.1101/268755","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1966881","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1301152","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.1371/journal.pbio.3000099","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.1445817","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"10.1145/2844544","relation":"cites","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"https://w3id.org/ro/2016-01-28/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"http://www.rohub.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://w3id.org/bundle/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.12586","relation":"references","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.17487/rfc8493","relation":"references","scheme":"doi"},{"identifier":"https://rd-alliance.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://www.force11.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://www.dataone.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://codemeta.github.io/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://psych-ds.github.io/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://data.research.uts.edu.au/examples/v1.0/datacrate-RO-2018/data/paper.html","relation":"cites","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/155lA2BcixTl-zwJHGfLkxsmg7WmQbBK00QWyP8QggkE/edit?usp=sharing","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://schema.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://json-ld.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://rd-alliance.org/approaches-research-data-packaging-rda-11th-plenary-bof-meeting","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"http://www.researchobject.org/overview/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://bioschemas.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://elixir-europe.org/news/eosc-life-start","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://jupyter.org/","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-lite/issues/1","relation":"references","scheme":"url"},{"identifier":"10.5281/zenodo.2636996","relation":"isVersionOf","scheme":"doi"}],"relations":{"version":[{"count":2,"index":0,"is_last":false,"last_child":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"3250687"},"parent":{"pid_type":"recid","pid_value":"2636996"}}]},"resource_type":{"subtype":"conferencepaper","title":"Conference paper","type":"publication"},"title":"A lightweight approach to research object data packaging"},"owners":[4363],"revision":8,"stats":{"downloads":45.0,"unique_downloads":39.0,"unique_views":72.0,"version_downloads":92.0,"version_unique_downloads":75.0,"version_unique_views":121.0,"version_views":147.0,"version_volume":14739371.0,"views":82.0,"volume":7391250.0},"updated":"2019-08-09T09:12:50.887109+00:00"}
