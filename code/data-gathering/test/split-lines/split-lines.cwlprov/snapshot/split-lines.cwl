inputs:
  splittable:
    type: File
    streamable: true
    doc: >
      The file which should be split
    inputBinding:
      position: 100

  prefix:
    type: string?
    default: x
    doc: > 
      Prefix for generated files, the default is "x", 
      e.g. generating "xaa", "xab", etc.
      
  lines:
    type: int?
    default: 1000
    doc: >
        maximum number of lines/records per output file. The last file may
        have less lines.
    inputBinding:
      prefix: "--lines"

  extension:
    type: string?
    doc: >
      Optional extension (additional suffix) for generated files, e.g. ".txt" 
      will generate "xaa.txt", "xab.txt" etc. The default is no extension.
    inputBinding:
      prefix: "--additional-suffix"

  separator:
    type: string?
    doc: >
      Character to split input file into records; default is \n (newline).

      This parameter must be an unescaped single character 
      (which may need to be escaped in CWL/YAML/JSON/shell),
      e.g. in YAML syntax \x1e for ASCII control character RE record separator.
      
      To split by NUL character use quoted literal
      '\0' in shell or double backslash \\0 in YAML
      
    inputBinding:
      prefix: "--separator"

      # does not guarantee any particular order, although particular file systems
      # and CWL engines might give such an apparence.

      # To ensure consistency with line order in file input, sort File[] array
      # in alphabetical order by the attribute basename.

label: "split a file into smaller pieces"

doc: >
    Output pieces of FILE by splitting into multiple files,
    e.g. "xaa", "xab", "xac", ... where "x" is the default prefix.

    The filename suffixes are alphabetical in order 
    corresponding to file input, using a suffix letters a-z.
      
    The suffix is expanded by 2 characters before exhaustion to "z", 
    making increasingly longer filenames that are still ordered
    correctly, e.g. "yy", "yz", "zaaa", "zaab", later
    "zyzz", "zzaaaa", "zzaaab".
