The aim of an RO is to replace traditional academic publications of static PDFs, to rather provide a complete and structured archive of the items (such as people, organisations, funding, equipment, software etc) that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations. This is increasingly important as researchers now rely heavily on computational analysis, yet we are facing a <em>reproducibility crisis</em> as key components are often not sufficiently tracked, archived or reported.</p>\n\n<p>We propose <strong>Research Object Crate</strong> (or <strong>RO-Crate</strong> for short), an emerging lightweight approach to package research data with their structured metadata, based on schema.org annotations in a formalized JSON-LD format that can be used independent of infrastructure to encourage FAIR sharing of reproducible datasets and analytical methods.</p>","doi":"10.5281/zenodo.3343031","grants":[{"acronym":"BioExcel-2","code":"823830","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::823830"},"program":"H2020","title":"BioExcel-2 Centre of Excellence for Computational Biomolecular Research"},{"acronym":"BioExcel","code":"675728","funder":{"acronyms":["EC"],"doi":"10.13039/501100000780","links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/funders/10.13039/501100000780"},"name":"European Commission"},"links":{"self":"https://zenodo.org/api/grants/10.13039/501100000780::675728"},"program":"H2020","title":"Centre of Excellence for Biomolecular Research"}],"license":{"id":"CC-BY-4.0"},"meeting":{"acronym":"BOSC","dates":"24-25 July 2019","place":"ISMB/ECCB 2019, Basel, Switzerland","title":"Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)","url":"https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/2019/"},"notes":"Poster presented at BOSC 2019.
